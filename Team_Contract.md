# Communication

## Team Meetings 
Our team will meet once a week every Saturday from 8-10 PM using Discord/in person. All team members will collaborate and work on the weekly development log together at the end of the meeting.

## Assistance
Each team member can be contacted through Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to discord messages within 24 hours.

## Respect
We do not believe in project leads. We believe that each team member is equally responsible for sharing their ideas. Every member of the group will have a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All thoughts will be taken into consideration, and one choice of decision will be voted. Once a decision has been made, each team member will respect and will not change the decisions later on.

# Collaboration

## Work Distribution
Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will be assigned to work on one or more deliverables with their preferences taken into consideration. Team members will be paired with another team member to work on tasks together. If a pair completes their task early, they will help the other pair with their work. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis. 

## Time Commitment
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication. The pair that was responsible for the longer task will update the rest of the team and divide the work up because they are most knowledgeable about what needs to be completed. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they need to provide “reasonable” circumstances and explanations. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

## Conflict Resolution
If a conflict arises, team members will meet in discord and discuss a viable solution to the conflict at hand. We will contact the TA for advice only if no clear solution can be made. The final decision will be voted on by team members.
