# Weekly Dev Log 4/16-4/23

This week we were able to successfully implement our graph using an adjacency list. We also finished writing BFS for our graph. We started writing test cases for the parser as well as BFS but we had some difficulties implementing them so we are still in the progress of debugging and finishing our tests.

One problem we had this week was our makefile, it took us a while to get it to work but when we did, the tests that we were able to write finally compiled smoothly.

Next week we are going to complete Dijkstra’s algorithm as well as DFS which will be used in our greedy coloring algorithm. We will also write test cases for Dijkstra’s and DFS.
