# Weekly Dev Log 4/24-5/1

This week we successfully implemented the greedy coloring algorithm and wroted several test cases for it. We started to implement dijkstra.

The problem we encountered this week was mainly the implementation of greedy coloring. With BFS finished last week, we finally finished writing colorGraph. We still have some problems with dijkstra, and we need to add more test cases for greedy coloring.

Next week we are going to complete Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm while adding more test cases to the completed algorithms. Also, we will start to prepare for our project presentation.
