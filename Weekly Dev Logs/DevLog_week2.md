# Dev Log week 1 (4/2 - 4/8)
This week, we created the make file and decided on how we would structure our project and create classes. We decided that we would make different classes for the airports (nodes), routes (edges), and the graph in general. We have implemented the airport class already. We have also finished most of the routes class except for a function that determines the weight (geographic distance between nodes) of each route.

Additionally, we have also implemented a very basic version of our data parser that goes through our data files and creates a graph based on the data. We will continue to implement that as we move into next week.\

Our goals for next week are to finish creating the graph by parsing the data and starting to implement the graph traversal algorithms. We plan to be finished with bfs and dfs for next week.
